# EMS - Employee Management System

This work is an introduction to databases and management systems that have been created to handle data. A relational database is a type of database management system that stores data in tables with columns and points that are related to each other. This is the basis for modern database systems like MySQL which utilize the Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform CRUD operations. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) describes the four basic functions of the modern web application.

## Description

This is a WIP! Follow my progress below:

- [ ] GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- [ ] WHEN I start the application
- [ ] THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
- [ ] WHEN I choose to view all departments
- [ ] THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
- [ ] WHEN I choose to view all roles
- [ ] THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
- [ ] WHEN I choose to view all employees
- [ ] THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
      WHEN I choose to add a department
- [ ] THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
- [ ] WHEN I choose to add a role
- [ ] THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
- [ ] WHEN I choose to add an employee
- [ ] THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
